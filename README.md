 Maintenance cost reduction through predictive techniques 
 <hr>
<h1><strong>BACKGROUND  </strong>A company has a fleet of devices transmitting daily telemetry readings.</h1> 
<hr>
Company would like to create a predictive maintenance solution to proactively identify when maintenance should be performed. The approach promises cost savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance because tasks are performed only when warranted. GOAL You are tasked with building a predictive model using machine learning to predict the probability of a device failure. When building this model, be sure to minimize false positives and false negatives. The column you are trying to predict is called failure with binary value 0 for non-failure and 1 for failure
